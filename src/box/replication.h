/**
 * @module replication - global state of multi-master
 * replicated database.
 *
 * Right now we only support asynchronous master-master
 * replication.
 *
 * Each replica set has a globally unique identifier. Each
 * replica in the replica set is identified as well.
 * A replica which is part of one replica set can not join
 * another replica set.
 *
 * Replica set and instance identifiers are stored in a system
 * space _cluster on all replicas. The instance identifier
 * is also stored in each snapshot header, this is how
 * the instance knows which instance id in the _cluster space
 * is its own id.
 *
 * Replica set and instance identifiers are globally unique
 * (UUID, universally unique identifiers). In addition
 * to these unique but long identifiers, a short integer id
 * is used for pervasive replica identification in a replication
 * stream, a snapshot, or internal data structures.
 * The mapping between 16-byte globally unique id and
 * 4 byte replica set local id is stored in _cluster space. When
 * a replica joins the replica set, it sends its globally unique
 * identifier to one of the masters, and gets its replica set
 * local identifier as part of the reply to the JOIN request
 * (in fact, it gets it as a REPLACE request in _cluster
 * system space along with the rest of the replication
 * stream).
 *
 * Replica set state on each replica is represented by a
 * table like below:
 *
 *   ----------------------------------
 *  | replica id       | confirmed lsn |
 *   ----------------------------------
 *  | 1                |  1258         | <-- changes of the first replica
 *   ----------------------------------
 *  | 2                |  1292         | <-- changes of the local instance
 *   ----------------------------------
 *
 * This table is called in the code "vector clock".
 * and is implemented in @file vclock.h
